                <li>If a session has less than <span ng-bind="usage.slidedLevels"></span> steps, NOOP state will be selected for the remaining levels.</li>
                <li>If a session has more than <span ng-bind="usage.slidedLevels"></span> steps, the remaining ones will be ignored.</li>
                <li>There might not be final state if the session was not assessed.</li>
                <li>The actions have not been divided to consider the type of devices created/deleted/modified to avoid too many states.</li>
