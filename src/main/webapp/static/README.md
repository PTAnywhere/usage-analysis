# Javascript dependencies

For your convenience, all the JS dependencies are provided in the _bower\_components_ directory.
However, all the JS code is maintained in other repositories.
These dependencies are defined using [Bower](http://bower.io) in the _bower.json_ file.


To get these libraries from their original repositories, simply use ``bower install`` (or ``bower update``).
