            <p>Notes to interpret the chart:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a session has less than <span ng-bind="usage.slidedLevels"></span> steps, NOOP state will be selected for the remaining levels.</li>
                <li>If a session has more than <span ng-bind="usage.slidedLevels"></span> steps, the remaining ones will not be displayed.</li>
                <li>The actions have not been divided to consider the type of devices created/deleted/modified to avoid too many states.</li>
                <li>For the sake of clarity, the chart does not show the final states.
                    You can check the final state for one specific session in the other version of this chart.</li>
